Personal Site

This is the repository containing my personal site. Right now, it is built exclusively from HTML/CSS with no JS.

I plan on continously building out the site as I develop my webdev skills, in the planned order below:
  1. Add JS scripts to animate and add some more interactive elements
  2. Utilize Bootstrap to practice using a framework.
  3. Utilize React.js to practice using a JS framework.
  4. Build a DB and use Hugo to serve the static site generated from the DB (learning some back-end!)
  5. ???
